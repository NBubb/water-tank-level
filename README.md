# water-tank-level
detect water level in tank and indicate if low

Introduction

This project was born out of a practical issue.  A hydralic ram pump lifts water from a spring seveal tens of meters below a holding tank of 3600 l.  The holding tank is large enough to ensure that there is at least one weeks worth of water avalable.  The hydralic ram pump ocasionaly stops pumping for a number of reasons.  This project is intended to inform when the water level of the tank is lower.  There is a water meter fitted with a pulse output in the system but this no longer regesters!!!  There is, thus, a need to identify the the level of the water in the tank.

There are mechanical float methods avalable, however, this project is centred on a diffrent aproch using an ultrasonic detector (I have an intrest in NDT and this apeals to me NB).
